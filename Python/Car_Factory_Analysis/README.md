# Car Factory Simulation Analysis

## Overview
The **Car Factory Simulation Analysis** project is a data science project for a car factory simulation model conducted at the **Catholic University of Lille**. The simulation model was constructed and run using **JaamSim**, while the data analysis was performed using **Python**. This project was part of our Data Science Basics course.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:

- Develop and simulate a car factory model to analyze production efficiency and optimize processes.
- Use data analysis techniques to gain insights from simulation outputs.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
1. **Simulation Modeling**
   - Building and simulating a car factory model using **JaamSim**.

2. **Data Analysis**
   - Analyzing simulation outputs using **Python** to derive insights and evaluate the factory's efficiency.

3. **Optimization**
   - Identifying areas of improvement and optimizing production processes based on data insights.

## Tools Used
- **JaamSim**: Constructing and simulating the car factory model.
- **Python**: Data analysis, visualization, and insights extraction.

## Project Components
1. **Simulation Construction and Execution**
   - Developed a car factory model in **JaamSim** to simulate production workflows.

2. **Data Collection and Analysis**
   - Collected outputs from the simulation and analyzed them using **Python** to assess factory performance.

3. **Optimization Insights**
   - Provided recommendations to optimize production efficiency based on the data analysis.

## Notes
This project demonstrates the integration of simulation modeling and data science to solve real-world manufacturing problems, providing valuable insights into production processes.
