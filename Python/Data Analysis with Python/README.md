# Data Analysis with Python - FreeCodeCamp

## Overview
The **Data Analysis with Python** project was part of the **FreeCodeCamp** Data Analysis with Python course. In this project, I used Python to analyze a dataset and gain meaningful insights through various data analysis techniques. The project involved data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and the use of statistical methods to understand the data better.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:

- Apply fundamental data analysis techniques to a real-world dataset.
- Use Python libraries such as **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** for data analysis and visualization.
- Gain hands-on experience with data manipulation, exploration, and insight generation.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Cleaning and preparing raw data for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Exploring the dataset to identify patterns, trends, and outliers.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Creating visual representations of the data using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to communicate insights effectively.

4. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Applying statistical methods to derive meaningful conclusions from the data using **SciPy**.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Main programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **SciPy**: Statistical analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Environment to write and run Python code interactively.

## Project Components
1. **Data Import and Cleaning**
   - Imported the dataset and cleaned it to ensure consistency and accuracy.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Conducted EDA to explore the data, identify trends, and gain initial insights.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Created various plots and charts to visualize data patterns and communicate findings.

4. **Statistical Insights**
   - Performed basic statistical analysis using **SciPy** to support the visual insights and conclusions.

## Certification
Upon completion of the course, I received a certificate recognizing the skills and insights gained:

- **Data Analysis with Python Certificate**: [View Certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/Reykkr/data-analysis-with-python-v7)

## Notes
This project highlights the core principles of data analysis, including cleaning, exploration, visualization, and deriving insights. It serves as an example of applying Python to solve real-world data problems effectively.
