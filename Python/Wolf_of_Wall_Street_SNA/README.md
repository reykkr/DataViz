Project: Social Network Analysis (SNA) - Group 3

Overview

The SNA_GROUPE3.ipynb notebook focuses on Social Network Analysis (SNA), a powerful tool for examining relationships and connections within a network. This project provides insights into network structures, key nodes, and connection dynamics, which can be applied in various fields such as marketing, sociology, and organizational analysis.

Objectives

Analyze Network Connections: Identify relationships between entities within the network.
Detect Key Nodes: Determine influential nodes (individuals, companies, or other entities) within the network.
Visualize Network Structure: Generate clear visual representations to illustrate the network's connections and structure.

Key Components

Data Loading and Preparation: Import and clean network data for analysis.
Network Metrics: Compute various metrics, such as degree centrality, closeness, and betweenness, to evaluate node importance.
Community Detection: Identify clusters or communities within the network.
Visualization: Generate network graphs to visually represent relationships and highlight influential nodes.

Skills Demonstrated

Python Programming: Data manipulation, visualization, and analysis with Python.
NetworkX Library: Leveraged for network analysis and metrics computation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Used for creating network visualizations.
