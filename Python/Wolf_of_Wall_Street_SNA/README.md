# Project: Social Network Analysis (SNA) - Group 3

The `SNA_GROUPE3.ipynb` notebook focuses on Social Network Analysis (SNA), a powerful tool for examining relationships and connections within a network. This project provides insights into network structures, key nodes, and connection dynamics, which can be applied in various fields such as marketing, sociology, and organizational analysis.

## Objectives

- **Analyze Network Connections**: Identify relationships between entities within the network.
- **Detect Key Nodes**: Determine influential nodes (individuals, companies, or other entities) within the network.
- **Visualize Network Structure**: Generate clear visual representations to illustrate the network's connections and structure.

## Key Components

1. **Data Loading and Preparation**
   - Import and clean network data for analysis.

2. **Network Metrics**
   - Compute various metrics, such as degree centrality, closeness, and betweenness, to evaluate node importance.

3. **Community Detection**
   - Identify clusters or communities within the network.

4. **Visualization**
   - Generate network graphs to visually represent relationships and highlight influential nodes.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Python Programming**: Data manipulation, visualization, and analysis with Python.
- **NetworkX Library**: Leveraged for network analysis and metrics computation.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Used for creating network visualizations.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. **Requirements**: Ensure Python and the necessary libraries are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install networkx matplotlib seaborn
   ```

2. **Open the Notebook**: Run the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook SNA_GROUPE3.ipynb
   ```

## Output

- The notebook generates network graphs and computes key metrics to provide insights into network structures, key nodes, and community dynamics.

## Notes

- The analysis provides a comprehensive view of the relationships and influence patterns within the network, making it applicable for use in diverse fields such as marketing, sociology, and organizational analysis.
